## Hardware Requirements

The Drone Detector is built specifically for the **LILYGO T-Beam S3-Core** device. This device features:

- **ESP32-S3** MCU with WiFi & Bluetooth 5 LE
- **Semtech SX1262** LoRa transceiver
- **Frequency options**: 433 MHz, 868 MHz, or 915 MHz variants
- **GPS module** (NEO-M10S or Quectel L76K)
- USB-C connectivity
- Boot and Reset switches for firmware flashing

:::danger IMPORTANT: Antenna Required

Never power on the device without attaching an antenna! Operating without an antenna can damage the radio chip permanently.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Verify Your Cable

Ensure you have a USB-C cable capable of data transfer (not just charging). Test by connecting to another device and verifying file transfer works.

### Step 2: Install Serial Drivers

For the ESP32-S3 based T-Beam S3-Core, you may need to install the appropriate USB-to-serial drivers:

- **Windows**: Install [CP210x drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) if not auto-detected
- **macOS/Linux**: Usually auto-detected, no additional drivers needed

### Step 3: Flash Firmware

To flash the Drone Detector firmware:

1. Unplug the device
2. Press and hold the **BOOT** button
3. While holding BOOT, plug in the USB-C cable
4. Release BOOT after 2-3 seconds
5. The device is now in firmware download mode
6. Use ESP-IDF, PlatformIO, or Arduino IDE to flash the firmware

### Step 4: First Boot

After flashing:

1. Disconnect and reconnect the device
2. The display will show the Drone Detector interface
3. Use the button to navigate through menus
