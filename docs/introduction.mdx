# Drone Detector

An open source drone detection system that uses RF signal analysis to identify and classify drones based on their communication frequency and modulation patterns.

## Overview

The Drone Detector is built on the **LILYGO T-Beam S3-Core** hardware platform, leveraging the powerful **RadioLib** library for comprehensive RF signal detection and analysis. The system identifies drones by matching their RF signatures against known frequency ranges and modulation types.

## How It Works

Drones communicate with their controllers using radio frequencies. Each drone manufacturer and model uses specific:

1. **Frequency Bands** - The radio spectrum where the drone operates
2. **Modulation Types** - How data is encoded in the radio signal (FHSS, DSSS, OFDM, etc.)
3. **Signal Patterns** - Unique characteristics of the transmission

The Drone Detector continuously scans supported frequency bands, analyzes incoming signals, and matches them against a database of known drone RF signatures.

## Detection Method

The detection process works by:

1. **Scanning** - Sweeping through frequency ranges using the SX1262 transceiver
2. **Signal Detection** - Identifying RF energy above the noise floor
3. **Modulation Analysis** - Determining the modulation type of detected signals
4. **Pattern Matching** - Comparing detected signals against known drone signatures
5. **Classification** - Identifying the drone type based on frequency/modulation match

## Supported Hardware

This project is designed exclusively for the **T-Beam S3-Core** device:

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| MCU | ESP32-S3 (WiFi & Bluetooth 5 LE) |
| Radio | Semtech SX1262 LoRa Transceiver |
| Frequencies | 433 MHz, 868 MHz, or 915 MHz (device variant) |
| GPS | NEO-M10S or Quectel L76K |
| Interface | OLED Display, User Button, USB-C |

## Key Features

- **Multi-frequency scanning** within the device's supported band
- **Real-time signal analysis** using RadioLib
- **Button-based menu navigation** for standalone operation
- **GPS location logging** for detected signals
- **Modulation detection** for drone classification
- **Low power operation** suitable for field deployment

## RadioLib Integration

This project uses [RadioLib](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib), a universal wireless communication library that provides:

- Support for SX1262 and many other radio modules
- Flexible modulation configuration (LoRa, FSK, OOK, etc.)
- Signal strength (RSSI) and quality measurements
- Frequency scanning and channel activity detection

## Limitations

The T-Beam S3-Core with SX1262 operates in sub-GHz bands (433/868/915 MHz). Many consumer drones operate on 2.4 GHz or 5.8 GHz, which are **not directly detectable** by this hardware. However, some drones and drone control systems do use sub-GHz frequencies for:

- Long-range control links
- Telemetry downlinks
- Remote ID broadcasts
- Some FPV systems
