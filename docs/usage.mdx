# Usage Guide

This guide covers how to operate the Drone Detector using the button interface and menu system.

## Button Controls

The T-Beam S3-Core has three buttons for device control:

| Button | Location | Functions |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Power** | Middle | Long press to power on/off |
| **Reset** | Right | Single press to restart device |
| **User** | Left | Menu navigation and selection |

### User Button Actions

| Action | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Single press | Next menu item / Change screen |
| Double press | Select / Confirm |
| Long press (3s) | Start/Stop scanning |
| Triple press | Switch frequency band |

## Main Menu

The device displays the following menu options:

1. **Scan** - Start RF scanning for drone signals
2. **Frequencies** - Configure frequency ranges to scan
3. **Detected** - View list of detected signals
4. **Settings** - Device configuration options
5. **GPS** - View current GPS location and status

## Scanning for Drones

### Starting a Scan

1. From the main menu, navigate to **Scan** using single button presses
2. Double press to select
3. Or use long press from any screen to quick-start scanning

### During Scanning

The display shows:
- Current frequency being scanned
- Signal strength indicator (RSSI)
- Number of signals detected
- Scan progress

When a potential drone signal is detected:
- Audio/visual alert (if enabled)
- Signal added to detection list
- GPS coordinates logged

### Stopping a Scan

- Long press the User button to stop scanning
- Or press Reset to restart the device

## Frequency Configuration

The detector scans within the frequency band of your device variant:

### 433 MHz Variant
- Range: 433.0 - 434.8 MHz
- Common uses: European drone telemetry, some remote controls

### 868 MHz Variant
- Range: 868.0 - 870.0 MHz
- Common uses: European ISM band, some drone systems

### 915 MHz Variant
- Range: 902.0 - 928.0 MHz
- Common uses: US ISM band, LoRa drones, some control systems

## Detection List

The **Detected** menu shows all signals identified as potential drone communications:

For each detection:
- **Frequency**: Exact frequency of the signal
- **RSSI**: Signal strength in dBm
- **Modulation**: Detected modulation type
- **Time**: Timestamp of detection
- **GPS**: Location coordinates (if GPS locked)
- **Match**: Drone type if signature matched

## Drone Signature Database

The detector matches signals against known drone RF signatures:

| Drone Type | Frequency Range | Modulation | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| DJI (some models) | 900-930 MHz | FHSS | OcuSync telemetry |
| Long-range FPV | 433 MHz | LoRa/FSK | Custom builds |
| Agricultural drones | 868/915 MHz | LoRa | Telemetry links |
| Racing drones | Various | FSK | Some control systems |

:::note
Many consumer drones use 2.4 GHz or 5.8 GHz which cannot be detected by this hardware. This device focuses on sub-GHz drone communications.

## Settings Menu

Configure device behavior:

- **Scan Speed**: Fast/Normal/Thorough
- **Alert Mode**: Visual/Audio/Both/None
- **Auto-scan**: Enable scanning on boot
- **Display**: Brightness and timeout
- **GPS**: Enable/disable GPS logging

## Tips for Effective Detection

1. **Antenna Positioning**: Keep the antenna vertical for best reception
2. **Location**: Higher positions provide better RF visibility
3. **Interference**: Move away from other electronic devices
4. **Scan Duration**: Longer scans catch intermittent transmissions
5. **Multiple Bands**: If possible, use multiple devices for different bands

## Understanding RSSI Values

| RSSI (dBm) | Signal Quality | Typical Range |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| -30 to -50 | Excellent | Very close (under 100m) |
| -50 to -70 | Good | Close (100-500m) |
| -70 to -90 | Fair | Medium (500m-1km) |
| -90 to -110 | Weak | Far (1km+) |
| Below -110 | Very weak | At detection limit |

## Troubleshooting

### No signals detected
- Verify antenna is properly connected
- Check you're in an area with drone activity
- Ensure correct frequency band for your region
- Try increasing scan duration

### GPS not locking
- Move to an area with clear sky view
- Wait 2-3 minutes for initial lock
- GPS works best outdoors

### Device not responding
- Press Reset button to restart
- If unresponsive, disconnect and reconnect power
